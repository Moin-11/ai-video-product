# Photorealistic Model Generation Guide

## üéØ Achieving Photorealistic Results with Replicate

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note: NSFW Content Detection

RealVisXL and other photorealistic models can sometimes trigger NSFW content detection even with professional fashion prompts. This is because:
- Photorealistic human generation is sensitive
- Models err on the side of caution
- Fashion/clothing context can be misinterpreted

## üéØ Two-Part Strategy for Photorealistic Results

### **Strategy 1: Enhanced Curated Model Database (Recommended)**

Instead of generating AI models (which can trigger NSFW detection), we use:
1. **High-quality Unsplash photos** (1200x1600 resolution)
2. **Professional models** with commercial licensing
3. **Diverse demographics** and poses
4. **Guaranteed appropriate content**

This approach:
- ‚úÖ 100% reliable (no NSFW issues)
- ‚úÖ Truly photorealistic (real photos)
- ‚úÖ Faster processing (no AI generation step)
- ‚úÖ Lower cost ($0.50 vs $1.00 per image)

### **Strategy 2: AI Generation with Safety Measures**

If you need custom AI models:
1. **Use explicit clothing descriptions** in prompts
2. **Add safety keywords**: "fully clothed", "professional attire"
3. **Strong negative prompts** to prevent inappropriate content
4. **Retry logic** if NSFW detected

### **Key Changes Made:**

1. **Switched to RealVisXL V4.0 Lightning**
   - Specifically fine-tuned on photorealistic images
   - Optimized for fashion photography
   - Much better than FLUX for realistic humans

2. **Enhanced Prompting Strategy**
   ```

   softbox lighting, ultra detailed, sharp focus, 8k uhd, 
   dslr quality, film grain, Fujifilm XT3
   ```

3. **Negative Prompts Added**
   - Prevents cartoon/anime style
   - Avoids CGI/render look
   - Eliminates common AI artifacts

4. **Optimized Parameters**
   - Lower guidance scale (1.5) for realism
