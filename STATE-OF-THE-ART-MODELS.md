wearing elegant business attire, full body pose, studio lighting, commercial photography, 
high resolution, natural skin texture, realistic eyes, fashion catalog style"
```

### **No Negative Prompts Needed:**
FLUX models are trained to avoid unwanted content naturally, so we use minimal negative prompts.

### **Raw Mode Benefits:**
- Natural lighting variations
- Subtle skin imperfections (realistic)
- Authentic photography feel
- Professional model expressions

## ⚡ Virtual Try-On Speed Optimization

### **IDM-VTON Parameter Tuning:**
```typescript
denoise_steps: 20,        // Reduced from 30 (faster)
guidance_scale: 1.5,      // Reduced for speed
timeout: 120s             // Reduced from 180s
```

### **Progressive Polling:**
- First 5 attempts: 1 second intervals
- Next 10 attempts: 2 second intervals  
- Remaining: 3 second intervals
- Maximum 2 minutes total

## 🛡️ NSFW Prevention (FLUX Models)

### **Built-in Safety:**
FLUX models have better built-in safety compared to SDXL models:
- Less likely to trigger false positives
- Better understanding of professional context
- Safety tolerance parameter for fashion photography

### **Professional Context Keywords:**
- "wearing elegant business attire"
- "professional fashion model photography"
- "commercial photography"
- "fashion catalog style"

## 🔬 Technical Implementation

### **Model Selection Logic:**
```typescript
const modelPriority = [
  'flux-ultra',    // FLUX 1.1 Pro Ultra (Raw mode)
  'flux-pro',      // FLUX Pro (fast alternative)
  'juggernaut'     // SDXL fallback
];

for (const model of modelPriority) {
  try {
    const result = await generateModel(model);
    return result; // Success!
  } catch (error) {
    // Try next model
  }
}
```

### **Dynamic Parameter Building:**
Each model uses its optimal parameters automatically:
- FLUX Ultra: Raw mode, high steps, safety tolerance
- FLUX Pro: Balanced speed/quality settings
- Legacy models: Traditional SDXL parameters
